# react-native-activitykit

This package allows for you to access Apple's [ActivityKit framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/activitykit) from your React Native Project.

ActivityKit enables developers to offer dynamic content sharing experiences with users that display as Live Activities and in the Dynamic Island.


>With the ActivityKit framework, you can start a Live Activity to share live updates from your app in the Dynamic Island and on the Lock Screen. For example, a sports app might allow a person to start a Live Activity that makes live information available at a glance for the duration of a game. On the Lock Screen, your Live Activity appears at the bottom of the screen. On devices that support the Dynamic Island, the Live Activity appears in the Dynamic Island on the Home Screen and while people use other apps. People tap a Live Activity in the Dynamic Island to launch your app, or touch and hold it to show an expanded presentation with more content
